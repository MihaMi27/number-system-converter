# Number System Converter
This is a project I did to learn about different number systems and binary coded digits.

I needed this knowledge as I attended a class about microcontrollers, assembly and boolean logic.

This is a android app that converts decimal, binary, hexadecimal numbers and binary coded digits (BCD) into other number systems mentioned previously.
It is written in Kotlin as my introductory project into Kotlin.
